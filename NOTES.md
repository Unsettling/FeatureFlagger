# Notes

## Development

### Paket

[Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) is an alternative to NuGet.

Some setup is required before you can being. Refer to the guides.

### TODO

- Make FeatureFlagger a meta-package and create FF.Core.
- Use MEF meta data instead of "name" for choosing readers and writers.
